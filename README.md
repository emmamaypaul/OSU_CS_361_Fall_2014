# OSU_CS_361_Fall_2014

This class was Software Engineering. The final project was a group project. Due to the fact that we all collaborated on it, I didn't include any of our source files. 

The project was to create a website called "Green Commuting Solutions". The idea of the website is that a user could create an account, and every time they choose to commute somewhere using a "green" option, the user would accumulate points that, in theory, could be used at "green" stores working with the website.
